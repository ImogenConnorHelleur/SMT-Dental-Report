## Contents 

#### Calendar data 2021/2022 (explanation slide 3)
###### April to October data only:
* Monthly UDA delivery of contracted quarterly value against threshold (4 and 5)
* Monthly UOA delivery of contracted quarterly value against threshold (8 and 9)
* N.B. these analyses exclude contracts with annual contracted UDAs of less than 
or equal to 100 and prototype contracts

#### Scheduled data activity slides (explanation slide 3)
* Monthly UDA delivery of contracted annual value scaled up by 12 (6)
* Monthly UOA delivery of contracted annual value scaled up by 12 (10)
* Historic banded Courses of Treatment comparison (12)
* Total urgent FP17 form count across financial years (13)  

*Please Note: Slides 4, 5, 8 and 9 use calendar data as a measure of activity.*
*Slides 6, 7, 10-13 use scheduled data, as per previous SMT data packs.*

## Calendar and scheduled data 
### Calendar data explanation 

* Slides 4, 5, 8 and 9 are based on calendar month data
* Calendar data is based on courses of treatment completed within an entire month, for example 1st February to 28th Feb
* For calendar data, if a COT was completed in February but not declared till March, that activity would still be registered as
occurring in February.
* This means that graphs using calendar data may change for historical months as more COTs are registered. 
* The activity % is now based on total number of UDA/UOAs delivered as a % of total contracted UDA/UOAs per quarter.


### Scheduled data explanation
* Slides 6, 7, 10-13 are based on scheduled data
* The scheduling time period is usually between the 20th of one month and the 20th of the next month i.e., 21st April to the
19th May. That means that any Mandatory contract COT completed after this period will not be included in the May
scheduled data. However, if for example a COT was completed on May 1st, but reported to the BSA after the end of the
reporting period (April 21st â€“ May 19th), that activity would go into the following scheduled period. As a result, the
scheduling period can be considered fixed.
* N.B.Scheduled data for April is from 1st April - 21st April. This has been taken into account when scaling up to annual delivery.

## Number of contracts by MY category
#### Including prototypes and contracts with annual contracted UDA < 100
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
knitr::kable(table_number_cat_contracts(remove_prototypes = F))
```
#### Excluding prototypes and contracts with annual contracted UDA < 100
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
knitr::kable(table_number_cat_contracts(remove_prototypes = T))
```
* See appendix for list of which type of contracts fall into each category.


## UDA activity data

                                  plot_chart = T)
```

* This graph shows the average monthly performance of the **`r get_num_contracts(level = params$level, region_STP_name = params$region_STP_name)`** GDS/PDS/PDS+ contracts scaled up by 12 months measured against the delivery thresholds (65% for Oct-Dec, 60% for Apr-Sep).
* In **`r format(Sys.Date() - lubridate::weeks(4), "%B")`**, scaled delivery was **62.4%**. This was **below** the 65% threshold.
* N.B. Previous month's delivery may be marginally different to what was reported last month
due to the nature of calendar data (see slide 3).

activity which is fixed. This may be thought of as "UDAs submitted" in each month rather than delivered.

GDS/PDS contracts scaled up by 12 months measured against the delivery thresholds (85% for Oct-Dec, 80% for Apr-Sep).
* In **`r format(Sys.Date() - lubridate::weeks(4), "%B")`**, **69.3%** of the total contracted UOAs for Q3 were delivered. This was **below** the 85% threshold.

**`r get_num_urgent_forms_2019(level = params$level, region_STP_name = params$region_STP_name)`**, which is a **`r round((get_num_urgent_forms(level = params$level, region_STP_name = params$region_STP_name) - get_num_urgent_forms_2019(level = params$level, region_STP_name = params$region_STP_name)) *100 / get_num_urgent_forms_2019(level = params$level, region_STP_name = params$region_STP_name))`%** change from the pre-COVID
